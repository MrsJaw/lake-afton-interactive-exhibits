# Lake Afton Public Observatory Interactive Exhibits
Web-based interactive slideshows and infographics for tablets and computers at the Lake Afton Public Observatory.

## Slideshows
The old LAPO computers contained some old slideshows and games. The files are in /legacy and we need to create new HTML/Javascript based slideshows and infographics based on the old slideshows and including any updates to out-of-date information.

Feel free to submit new slideshows and infographics as well.

## Technology
- [Reveal JS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) for the presentations.

## Branding
In an effort to maintain consistent, professional branding, please use the logos and brand standards. If you have any questions or need feedback, Andrew Stephens has offered to advise.
